# Knowledge_Representation


## Introduction
This repository demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts and functionalities. The code snippets cover essential topics such as conditional statements, loops, functions, classes, and data structures, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Additional examples illustrate operations such as handling user input, manipulating strings, working with exceptions, and implementing control flow using `if-else` statements.

These examples aim to provide a clear understanding of Pythonâ€™s core features, serving as a foundational guide for beginners and a quick reference for intermediate users.
## Code Breakdown

### 1. Basic Print and Conditional Statements
- Demonstrates the `print()` function and the usage of boolean variables (`True`, `False`) in conditional statements (`if-elif-else`).

### 2. Logical Operators
- Shows how to use `and`, `or`, and `not` operators in decision-making contexts.

### 3. Comparing Variables
- Examples of comparison operators like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` for numeric comparisons.

### 4. While Loop
- Includes a guessing game where a user guesses a price, demonstrating the use of `while` loops and the `break` statement.

### 5. For Loop
- Examples of looping over strings, lists, and ranges using `for` loops.

### 6. Lists
- Introduction to creating, accessing, slicing, modifying, and performing operations on lists, including sorting, appending, and counting elements.

### 7. 2D Lists (Matrices)
- Creation of a matrix (2D list) and iterating through its elements using nested `for` loops.

### 8. Tuples
- Explains immutable data structures (tuples), including operations like counting occurrences and unpacking values.

### 9. Dictionaries
- Shows how to create and manipulate dictionaries, including accessing and modifying values and adding new key-value pairs.

### 10. Functions
- Defines and calls simple functions with positional and keyword arguments, as well as demonstrates return values.

### 11. Exception Handling
- Provides examples of using `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions like `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError`.

### 12. Classes and Objects
- Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) by defining a simple `Keyboard` class with attributes and methods.

## Packages, Modules, and Dependencies
This project primarily uses Pythonâ€™s standard library. No external dependencies are required, so the examples can be run with a standard Python 3.x installation.

### Built-in Functions and Modules
- **Standard I/O**: `print()` for output, `input()` for receiving user input.
- **Data Conversion**: `int()`, `str()`, and `len()` for basic data manipulation.
- **Exception Handling**: `try-except` blocks to handle errors such as `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError`.
- **Looping**: `range()` for generating sequences.
